    content: |-
      Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development. I am currently a graduate student at Virginia Tech, pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science in Blacksburg, Virginia. Iâ€™m well versed in areas such as Software Engineering, Data Analytics, Database Systems, Big Data and User Interfaces. My core technical skillset is Python, JavaScript, Pandas, Numpy, ReactJS, SQL, HTML/CSS, Elasticsearch, Docker and Apache Spark. Apart from this, I also love project management - managing teams and projects, coordinating team efforts and ensuring reliable and quality delivery. 

      During my leisure hours, I find joy in a variety of activities, including playing the piano, reading books, experimenting in the kitchen, and venturing on hikes. While I dedicated numerous years to western classical music, my current inclination is towards spontaneous piano improvisation. In the realm of literature, I am an avid reader across all genres with a particular love for fantasy fiction. I possess a natural curiosity for seeking out novel experiences and innovative avenues for personal and professional growth.
